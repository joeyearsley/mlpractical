    "# Introduction to Coursework #2\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains some extended versions of hints and some code examples that are suppose to make it easier to proceed with certain tasks in Coursework #2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you proceed onwards, remember to activate your virtual environment by typing `activate_mlp` or `source ~/mlpractical/venv/bin/activate` (or if you did the original install the \"comfy way\" type: `workon mlpractical`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syncing the git repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Look <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a> for more details. But in short, we recommend to create a separate branch for the coursework, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter the mlpractical directory `cd ~/mlpractical/repo-mlp`\n",
    "2. List the branches and check which are currently active by typing: `git branch`\n",
    "3. If you have followed our recommendations, you should be in the `lab5` branch, please commit your local changes to the repo index by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -am \"finished lab5\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Now you can switch to `master` branch by typing: \n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    " ```\n",
    "5. To update the repository (note, assuming master does not have any conflicts), if there are some, have a look <a href=\"https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/mlpractical/blob/master/gitFAQ.md\">here</a>\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. And now, create the new branch & switch to it by typing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout -b coursework2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Store the intermediate results (check-pointing and pickling)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have finished a  task it is a good idea to check-point your current notebook's status (logs, plots and whatever else has been stored in the notebook). By doing this, you can always revert to this state later when necessary. You can do this by going to menus `File->Save and Checkpoint` and `File->Revert to Checkpoint`.\n",

    "Another good practice would be to save models and the statistics you generate to disk. You can easily do this in python by using *cPickle*, as in the following example."

But take care, since one can easily find ill-conditioned cases where this test might fail - either due to numerical precision when gradients get really small, or other because of issues like discontinuities in transfer functions (ReLU, Maxout) where perturbing the inputs might cause the piecwise component to cross \"the border\". For instance, for ReLU assume $f(x) < 0$ by a some small margin in argument $x$ and the gradient is correctly set to 0. However, the finite difference quotient rule with some $\\epsilon$ such $f(x+\\epsilon) > 0$  will give a non-zero numerical gradient. Anyway, this method remains very useful in verifying whether the implemented forward and backward pasees are mutually correct.\n",

    "Below we do some benchmarks on each of the above functions. Notice the huge speed-up in going from non-optimised cython code to an optimised one (on my machine, 643ms -> 6.35ms - this is 2 orders of magnitude!). It is still around two times slower than the BLAS accelerated numpy.dot routine (the non-cached result is around 3.3ms). But our method just benchmarks the dot product, an operation that has been optimised incredibly well in numerical libraries. Of course, we **do not** want you to use this code for dot products and you should rely on functions provided by numpy (whenever reasonably possible). The above code was just given as an example how to produce much more efficient code with very small effort. In many scenarios (convolution is an example) the code is more complex than a single dot product and some looping is necessary anyway, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional tensors where atomic operations using direct loop-based indexing may be much easier to comprehend (and debug) than a direct multi-dimensional manipulation of numpy tensors."
